# CSC-3102-2023

This was a old summer class project portfolio of mine; we were tasked to implement C# versions of various data structures within 3 months and with most of us (including me) not having extensive knowledge of C#.
I throughly enjoyed the class, but it was definitely stressful. Might revisit the concept of implementing data structures in other languages, but for right now I'm good.
